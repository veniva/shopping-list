# shopping-list
A JavaScript demo app - create a shopping list

Entirely client-side based. No server-side. It uses the browsers localStorage to store the data from the list.  
It also takes an advantage of the browser's offline cache, so once visited it can be used offline as well (IE10+)
  
Initially a demo list of three items is loaded.  
  
Usage:  
- add new items on pressing "Enter" key while in the new item's row, or pressing the button "add item"
- edit items - the content is saved as you edit (type or check the checkboxbox)  
- remove item - well ... it is obvious
